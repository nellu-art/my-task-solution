## Installation

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12.x.x or later)
- npm (version 6.x.x or later)

You can check your versions with the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

   Replace `https://github.com/username/repository.git` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   Change your current directory to the project's directory with the following command:

   ```bash
   cd repository
   ```

   Replace `repository` with the name of the directory that was created when you cloned the repository.

3. **Install the dependencies**

   Now, you need to install the project's dependencies. You can do this with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command installs all the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the development server**

   After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the Vite development server. By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:5000`, but this can be configured in the `vite.config.js` file.

## Conclusion

You should now have the React project running on your local machine. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the project's documentation or contact the repository's maintainers.
